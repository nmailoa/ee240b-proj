\section{Introduction}

We will propose a design for the integrator stages of an oversampled ADC. The design is driven by some specifications that include input-referred electronic noise, settling time as well as settling accuracy. We have chosen to use the same integrator architecture for both stages but tune the component values for each stage.


\section{System-level Considerations}

We started the design by modeling the ADC as transfer functions. We noticed that since the circuit implements an integration, the first stage should be a lot more carefully designed than the second stage. The input-referred noise transfer function from the output of the first stage is $N_1 = 2(z-1)$ while the second stage has a contribution that is affected by $N_2 = 0.25(z-1)^2$, assuming a second stage gain of 0.5. These transfer functions are also used later to verify the input-referred electronic noise of the circuit.

We estimated that the noise power contribution of the second stage is approximately 1000 times smaller than the first stage. We also noted that if we split the noise of a stage to each phases' noises ($\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$), the noise from $\Phi_1$ is integrated along with the signal and is more important than the $\Phi_2$ noise. 

\section{Integrator Implementation}

Each integrator stage of the oversampled ADC has a gain of 0.5 and has to settle within 0.1\% in 1.8ns wih a +/- 1V differential input. Fig. \ref{fig:int} shows the implementation of the integrator stages.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{illus/integrator}
\caption{Switched capacitor integrator}
\label{fig:int}
\end{figure}

During $\Phi_1$, $C_S$ samples the input and during $\Phi_2$ the input is amplified through charge transfer between $C_S$ and $C_F$. The $\Phi_2$ switch connecting the two sampling capacitors is a common mode rejection mechanism, transferring only the differential charge to $C_F$. $C_F$ is connected in the feedback only during the amplification phase $\Phi_2$ and is never reset, thus it integrates the input over time. $C_L$ is the load capacitance; for the first stage this is the the sampling capacitor of the second stage, and for the second stage this is the input capacitance of the comparator.

Since the amplifiers form a second-order integrator, the first amplifier noise dominates the total noise. We begin by choosing $C_S$ from the noise specification and the equation for noise at $\Phi_1$. 

$$N_{\Phi 1} = \frac{kT}{C_S + C_L}$$
$$N_{\Phi 2} = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}\frac{kT}{C_{L,tot}}$$

The value of $C_F$ is easily obtained from the required gain since the gain of the integrator is $C_F/C_S$. We want to budget $3.5 \mu$$V_{RMS}$ to the noise at $\Phi_1$ per differential input, but the signal bandwidth that we care about is only 100-500kHz and our equation for $N_{\phi 1}$ is over the entire spectrum. Therefore, we need to multiply the noise specification by the Oversampling Ratio, which is $\frac{f_S}{2BW}$. The noise that we want at the input therefore is $N_{\Phi 1}=250 \cdot (3.5)^2 \cdot 10^{-12} V/\sqrt{Hz}$. We rounded the capacitor values up to get some headroom for error.

%IMPT VALS
$$C_S = 1.5pF$$ 
$$C_F = 3pF$$

Our load capacitor is the sampling capacitor of stage 2. We first started at 100fF and iterated the design process to size the load capacitor $C_L$.

We next calculate the $G_m$ of the OTA necessary to meet the settling time with those capacitors from the settling time requirement. The equation below expresses the dynamic settling error specification assuming an amplifier with a closed loop pole at $\tau$ and a zero.

$$t_s = -\tau ln \left(\epsilon_d \left(1-\beta \frac{C_F}{C_F-C_L}\right)\right)$$

We budget half of the error to static error, so $\epsilon_d = 0.0005$. This results in a required transconductance of $G_m = 10.5mS$.

Next we calculated the required open loop gain of the amplifier. Since we are budgeting half of the settling error to static error, we require that
$$\frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{\beta A} = \epsilon_s = 0.0005$$

With a $\beta$ of 0.67, the required open loop gain is 3000, or 70 dB. This results in a required output resistance of $300k\Omega$.

With the design parameters, we started by building an ideal OTA using a VCCS. We created a testbench for AC, noise, and transient analysis and ran simulations to make sure the settling time, and noise requirements are met. The noise simulation was a performed with a noise current source from a resistor of value $\frac{\alpha}{G_m}$ inside of the OTA and $10\Omega$ ON resistances in series with all of the switches. However, PSS and PNOISE are not really meant for integrators so we exported the noise density at the output of the integrator to Matlab, then multiplied by the input-refered transfer function from the noise source and then integrated over the signal bandwidth.

\section{Design Alternatives}

We started with a telescopic OTA with an NMOS input but quickly realized that the $V_{GS}$ of the input device is too large to get the V* we want since the input common mode of the OTA is $600mV$. To achieve high current efficiencies (low V*) the gate-source voltage of the device has to be close to the threshold voltage. We found that a $V_{GS}$ of 0.4V is required to achieve a V* of $0.14V$. Such a low V* is ideal in our situation since larger current requires larger devices, which reduces the $r_o$ of the devices.

Next we moved to a folded cascode OTA architecture. With a folded cascode, the $V_{GS}$ of the input device can be almost arbitrarily set by the tail current. Setting the $V_{GS}$ to $0.4V$ provides us with the V* we desired. 

The transconductance $g_m$ we needed is limited by the dynamic settling time. Using the dynamic settling equation with a pole and a zero, we found that the $g_m$ required for the OTA is $\_21mS\_$. With a V* of $0.14V$, the drain current is $\_1.5mA\_$.

We set the current of the cascode branch to be greater than the current flowing through the input devices so the cascode devices never has zero current flowing through them even during slewing. This is important since the slew rate is now only dependent on the first stage current.

To avoid slewing for extended periods of time, the current in the input device has to be large enough to charge the load capacitance. Since when the closed loop amplifier is subjected to a step input there is a capacitive divider effect from the input to the output node, the output has to slew more than the maximum single-ended output swing of $0.25V$. Designing for a $0.5V$ slew in 0.4ns, with a total load capacitance of $C_{Ltot} = C_L + (1-\beta)C_F = \_1.1pF\_$, the current needed in the input devices is $1.5mA$. Since the required $g_m$ of the OTA already enforces this drain current, we do not need to worry about slewing.

After attempting to build the OTA, we discovered that getting the output resistance to be high is very hard with the current architecture. The required open loop gain is $3000$, and with a $g_m$ of $\_21mS\_$ the required output resistance is $\_143k\Omega\_$. With the bias currents in the design, this output resistance is unachievable.

To realize the high output resistances, we added gain boosters to the folded cascode OTA. The gain booster requirements are derived from the current output resistance and the bandwidth of the OTA. Fig. \ref{fig:main-ota} shows the gain-boosted folded cascode OTA circuit. based on the output resistance looking up from the output node $R_{out, up} = g_{m7}r_{o7}(r_{o5}||r_{o3}||r_{o1})$, the PMOS gain booster require an open loop gain of $36dB$. On top of that, the unity gain of the gain booster has to be larger than the 3dB bandwidth of the closed loop amplifier; we set the unity gain bandwidth to \_\_.

The output resistance looking down from the output node is $R_{out, down} = g_{m9}r_{o9}r_{o11}$. This is relatively high compared to $R_{out, up}$, but is still not high enough to meet the total output resistance of $\_143k\Omega\_$. We also added a gain booster with an open loop gain of \_\_ and a unity gain bandwidth of \_\_.

To build these gain boosters, we attempted to use a common differential pair, but the input voltage bias and the output voltage bias are not ideal for such an architecture. For example, the PMOS gain boosters have an input voltage of $1V$ and an output voltage of $0.4V$. Using an NMOS input device would result in too much $V_{GS}$, hence too high V*. Just like the main OTA, we solved this problem by implementing a folded cascode.

\section{Design Critique}

Our integrator circuit is over designed. We settle faster than the required spec and have lower noise than required. The circuit has a large footprint and burns more power than necessary to do this. We could have traded some power to more closely meet specs, especially in the second stage, where we had to add a load cap in order to get the necessary phase margin. If power was a tight spec, then we would have done this, but considering variation across the die and across chips, we decided that it was better to overshoot and make a circuit that is more easily built and with a better yield. This is especially important for our circuit because we chose very particular widths and lengths for our mosfets, which makes the circuit harder to actualize in silicon. Variation would have a large effect, so a little over-design is not a huge problem if the power budget can afford it. If we had more time we would have continued to tweak values and biases to see if we could obtain the same performance for lower power.

Second, our design did not take flicker noise into account. If we had, then our larger width and higher power would have been an advantage, but we assumed that since this was for an ADC application it was typical to add a chopper and then flicker would not be a concern.

Our design did not do anything to correct for offset, which might be a concern because our input devices are a bit small and thus variation would have a significant effect. However, considering that the application is an ADC this is not too concerning because the effect of OTA offset from fabrication mismatch is negligible because Delta-Sigma modulators are relatively insensitive to offset [3].








\begin{comment}


\section{Design}
For this project the important specifications are:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} 
\hline
Gain (Stage 1) & 0.5 \\
\hline
Input Referred Noise & $10\mu$ $V_{RMS}$ \\
\hline
Settling & 0.1\% in 1.8ns \\
\hline
Sampling Freq & 250M Hz \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

We divided the settling error requirement evenly between static and dynamic error, so $\epsilon_d = 0.05\%$. Furthermore, we decided to budget noise based on the noise factor calculations from the previous section. We see that the noise $\phi_1$ is the most important contribution to the noise. $\phi_2$ will be divided by a factor of 1000, therefore budget nearly all of the noise requirements for noise from $N_{11}$. The spec is for differential noise, so calculating single ended, we need to hit $5\mu$ $V_{RMS}$. We divide that further up, so that there is $3\mu$ $V_{RMS}$ for one input of the first integrator, and $1\mu$ $V_{RMS}$ for one input of the second stage and output of the second stage, taking advantage of the fact that the second integrator can be designed with much looser noise requirements.

From these specifications, we see that the small noise and rapid settling time will require careful design to meet both simultaneously. We began by considering a basic switched capacitor integrator in fig. \ref{int1} to get an idea of the what values were needed to meet $3\mu$ $V_{RMS}$ per input. We can use a design process similar to that of a sample and hold circuit, with only minor differences due to different switches.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{illustrator/integrator1}
\caption{Basic switched capacitor gain stage}
\label{int1}
\end{figure}

The necessary equations are below. \newline
Gain:
$$\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}=\frac{C_S}{C_F}$$
Settling Time:
$$t_s = -\tau ln \left(\epsilon_d \left(1-\beta \frac{C_F}{C_F-C_L}\right)\right)$$
Noise:
$$N_{\phi 1} = \frac{kT}{C_S + C_L}$$
$$N_{\phi 2} = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}\frac{kT}{C_{L,tot}}$$
Where in these equations $\alpha$ is the noise factor of the OTA - we used $\alpha = 2$ for the design - and $\beta$ is the feedback factor. $$\beta = \frac{C_F}{C_S + C_F + C_L}$$ 
In addition, $C_{L,tot}$ is the effective capacitive load.$$C_{L,tot}=C_L+(1-\beta)C_F$$
And $\tau$ is the time constant of the system. $$\tau = \frac{C_{L,tot}}{\beta G_m}$$

\subsection{First Integrator Stage}

We begin by choosing $C_S$ from the noise spec and the equation for $\phi_1$. Then $C_F$ is easily obtained from the required gain. We want to meet $3\mu$ $V_{RMS}$ per input, but the BW that we care about noise is only 100-500kHz and our equation for $N_{\phi 1}$ is over the entire spectrum [1]. Therefore, we need to multiply the noise spec by the Oversampling Ratio, which is $\frac{f_S}{2BW}$. The noise that we want at the input therefore is $N_{11}=250 \cdot 9\cdot 10^{-12} V/\sqrt{Hz}$.
%IMPT VALS
$$C_S = 2pF$$ 
$$C_F = 4pF$$
These are somewhat large capacitor values to drive. We next calculate the $G_m$ of the OTA necessary to meet the settling time with those capacitors from $\tau$. We get $G_m = 9mS$, which is a little large, but should be doable with large width MOSFETs.
We began adding parasitics to the transconductor. Parasitic capacitors are from $C_{GS}=\frac{g_m}{\omega_T}$ and we made a first optimistic guess at a conservative $r_o=10k$ and found that in simulation we needed significantly larger $G_m$. A small $G_m$ would result in a small loop gain due to the non-infinite $r_o$, which creates a significant static settling error.
We decided that $G_m$ was getting a little large and decided to check a cascaded setup shown in fig. \ref{int2}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{illustrator/integrator2}
\caption{Cascaded amplifiers with Miller compensation}
\label{int2}
\end{figure}
 
The relevant equations for this part change only a little:
$$\tau = \frac{C_C}{\beta g_{m1}}$$
$$N_{\Phi 2} = \frac{\alpha_1}{\beta} \frac{kT}{C_C} \left( 1+\beta \frac{\alpha_2}{\alpha_1} \frac{C_C}{C_{Ltot}} \right)$$

However, most of the equations for poles and zeros are very approximated, and they do not take into account that the cascaded amplifiers are more stable when $g_{m1}$ is larger than $g_{m2}$. We also had to use a Miller capacitance for pole splitting.

We had to iteratively find a stable value of $g_m$s that met timing, and eventually settled on $g_{m1}=20mS$, $g_{m2}=4mS$.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/cascaded-tran}
\caption{Transient response of 2-stage amplifier with Miller compensation}
\label{cascaded-tran}
\end{figure}

These value of $g_m$ are not significantly better than the single stage transconductor and the noise of a single stage is better, so we decided that a very large diff pair would be better than cascading.

We re-examined the parasitic resistance and decided that increasing the $r_o$ was the next best option, so that we needed the first stage OTA to be a single stage diff pair with cascoding, and approximated the new $r_o$ as a conservative $100k\Omega$.

We ran a final transient sim to make sure that the settling time of the output of the first stage was 1.8ns to 0.1\%. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/stage1-tran}
\caption{Transient response of first integrator with single-stage amplifier}
\label{stage1-tran}
\end{figure}

The noise simulation was a performed with a noise current source from a resistor of value $\frac{\alpha}{G_m}$ inside of the OTA and $10\Omega$ ON resistances in series with all of the switches. However, PSS and PNOISE are not really meant for integrators so we exported the noise density at the output of the integrator to Matlab, then multiplied by the transfer function from the noise source $N_{12}$ to the input and then integrated over the BW.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/noise-stage1}
\caption{Input-referred noise density from the first integrator stage}
\label{noise-stage1}
\end{figure}

The integrated noise is $2.245\mu V_{RMS}$ which gives us a lot of room to change $C_s$ if we need it.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} 
\hline
$C_S$ & 2pF \\
\hline
$C_F$ & 4pF \\
\hline
$G_M$ & 19mS \\
\hline
$R_{o,min}$ & 100k$\Omega$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In this stage, the most important design factor is meeting the noise requirement. This means that if noise is a problem later in the problem we can increase $C_S$. However, since we are very cleanly meeting the noise spec, we can trade some of it for lower $G_m$ in the gain stage. The large capacitors in the feedback loop relative to the load capacitance of the next stage mean we don't need quite as good of output resistance to keep static error within spec.

\subsection{Second Integrator Stage}

For second stage, we are meeting a noise spec which is 1000 times more lenient. Thus, we can choose much smaller feedback capacitance and $G_m$ of the OTA can be much more lenient. Using the same design procedure as before we obtain the values for the second integrator, also with a gain of 0.5. A larger gain would marginally help with the noise requirements, but a smaller gain would result in a higher $\beta$, hence higher loop gain. This is required once we have some load resistance at the output to meet the static settling error with a reasonable $G_m$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} 
\hline
$C_S$ & 30fF \\
\hline
$C_F$ & 15fF \\
\hline
$G_M$ & 5mS \\
\hline
$R_{o,min}$ & 1M$\Omega$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


We did find, that because the feedback capacitors are not on the same order as the load cap, the static error is a much bigger concern, so we need to meet a larger output resistance of the OTA in order to keep the $g_m$ build-able with one stage.

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{OTAs}
The above simulations confirmed that we needed reasonably large $G_m$ OTAs, and that output resistance is more important for the second stage than the first stage.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{illustrator/cascoded-diffpair}
\caption{Cascoded fully-differential pair}
\label{cascoded-diffpair}
\end{figure}

For the first stage we want a differential pair with reasonably large output resistance. We propose the cascoded fully-differential pair in fig. \ref{cascoded-diffpair}.
$M_1$ and $M_2$ completely determine the $G_m$ of the OTA and will need to be sized accordingly. The large width of $M_1$ and $M_2$ necessitates using cascoding at least on the input caps, but careful sizing of $M_5$ and $M_6$ should meet the required output resistance of the first stage without having to use a full telescopic design which will limit the output swing a lot.

For the second stage, however, we need better output resistance, in which case we need a telescopic differential pair, but we should not need gain boosting. The output voltage swing is not defined in the spec, so cascoded devices is feasible.

\subsection{Switches}
The resistance of the switches is somewhat of a concern, especially for the sampling switch. The time constant of this switch with $C_S$ needs to be substantially low such that the sampling capacitor has time to charge sufficiently, and that the switch can drive over the large input range. Therefore, the first switch, at least, needs to be a reasonably wide transmission gate.

The problem with large switches is that they have a lot of charge injection. To avoid that, we are making sure that we use early switches to disconnect the sampling cap and to implement bottom plate sampling.

\subsection{Integrators}
At the integrator level, we have been dealing only with the specs for this project. The project does not specify a CMRR or amount of variation that we have to be able to deal with in fabrication. However, these are things that have to be dealt with.

We propose the integrator implementation in fig.\ref{integrator3} to deal with problems outside of simulation.

The switch between the inputs to the OTA marked with the red box is to improve the CMRR by canceling the common mode offset [2]. The effect of OTA offset from fabrication mismatch is negligible because Delta-Sigma modulators are relatively insensitive to offset [3].

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
